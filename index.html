          <h2>How this list is made</h2>
          <p>Films make alot of revenue from various sources. Since the theatrical box office provides the most available data, that is the metric that this list is calculated off. Generally war films, musicals and historical dramas were the most popular genres, but since the 21st century the super hero genre has been the most popular.<br>
          Due to inflation most of the films achievments from the 1960s and 1970s have benn neglected. Some of the older films that held the record still have a respectable position by todays standards. due to higher individuel ticket prices they can no longer compete numerically to more modern movies.</p>
